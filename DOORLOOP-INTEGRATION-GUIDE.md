# DoorLoop Integration Guide for MaintenanceBot

## Overview

This guide explains how to integrate your MaintenanceBot VAPI assistant with DoorLoop's property management system.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Created

All 7 tools have been configured to work with DoorLoop API:

| Tool | DoorLoop Action | Priority | Status |
|------|----------------|----------|--------|
| **createWorkOrder** | Create Task | Based on urgency | Not Started |
| **escalateToEmergency** | Create High Priority Task | High | Not Started |
| **dispatchEmergencyVendor** | Add Update to Task | High | Not Started |
| **provideStatus** | Get Task by ID | N/A | N/A |
| **confirmCompletion** | Update Task Status | N/A | Completed |
| **reopenWorkOrder** | Update Task Status | Based on urgency | Not Started |
| **scheduleInspection** | Create Inspection Task | Medium | Not Started |

## üîë Authentication

**Your DoorLoop API Token:**
```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiQVBJIiwiaWQiOiI2OGVlNmZiYjIxYjI0MjkxYjdmZTM4ODgiLCJleHAiOjIwNzU4MTY2MzV9.6D_BgXStGG-yVE5dogTmp_KQ7So0GRhtOBXbMUyLS1I
```

**Base URL:**
```
https://app.doorloop.com/api
```

**Required Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer [token]`
- `Accept: application/json`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

---

## üìã How It Works

### 1. Intake Mode ‚Üí Create Work Order

**When:** Tenant calls with new maintenance issue

**What Happens:**
1. Bot collects: unit number, name, phone, issue description
2. Bot classifies urgency: urgent/standard/low
3. Bot calls `createWorkOrder` tool
4. **DoorLoop Action:** Creates task with:
   - Subject: `[category] - [unit]: [issue]`
   - Description: Full details including tenant info
   - Priority: High (urgent), Medium (standard), Low (low)
   - Status: "Not Started"

**Example Task Created:**
```
Subject: plumbing - 204: Kitchen sink leaking under cabinet
Priority: High
Status: Not Started
Description:
Tenant: Sarah Johnson
Phone: 555-789-1234
Unit: 204
Category: plumbing

Issue Description:
Kitchen sink is leaking under the cabinet. Water is dripping steadily when faucet is on.

Reported: this morning
```

---

### 2. Emergency Mode ‚Üí High Priority Task

**When:** Emergency detected (HVAC failure in extreme temp, major leak, etc.)

**What Happens:**
1. Bot provides immediate safety guidance
2. Bot calls `escalateToEmergency` tool
3. **DoorLoop Action:** Creates task with:
   - Subject: `üö® EMERGENCY - [category] - [unit]`
   - Priority: High
   - Safety notes included
   - Expected response times documented

**Example Emergency Task:**
```
Subject: üö® EMERGENCY - hvac - 105
Priority: High
Status: Not Started
Description:
‚ö†Ô∏è EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE REQUEST ‚ö†Ô∏è

Tenant: Michael Davis
Phone: 555-321-9876
Unit: 105
Category: hvac

Issue Description:
Complete HVAC failure, no heat at all

Safety Notes:
Tenant has 2-year-old child, outside temperature 25F

EXPECTED RESPONSE: Vendor should arrive within 1-2 hours
EXPECTED CALLBACK: Vendor should call tenant within 15 minutes
```

---

### 3. Emergency Dispatch ‚Üí Add Update

**When:** After safety guidance provided

**What Happens:**
1. Bot calls `dispatchEmergencyVendor` tool
2. **DoorLoop Action:** Adds update/note to existing task
3. Documents that emergency coordinator has dispatched
4. **Property Manager Action Required:** Assign vendor manually

**Example Update Added:**
```
‚úÖ EMERGENCY DISPATCHED

Category: hvac
Estimated Arrival: 1hour
Tenant Contact: 555-321-9876

Safety Notes:
Tenant has small child, extreme cold outside (25F)

‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED: Property manager must assign vendor and ensure callback within 15 minutes

Status: Emergency coordinator has confirmed dispatch to tenant
```

---

### 4. Followup Mode ‚Üí Completion or Reopen

**Scenario A: Issue Resolved**

Bot calls `confirmCompletion`:
- Updates task status to "Completed"
- Adds tenant feedback and quality rating
- Documents completion date

**Scenario B: Issue NOT Resolved**

Bot calls `reopenWorkOrder`:
- Updates status back to "Not Started"
- Increases priority if needed
- Adds detailed notes about why reopening
- Documents that vendor must return at no cost

---

### 5. Inspection Scheduling

**When:** Major repair (>$500) or tenant has concerns

Bot calls `scheduleInspection`:
- Creates NEW task for manager inspection
- Links to original work order ID
- Includes tenant availability
- Priority: Medium

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Adding Tools to VAPI Dashboard

Unfortunately, VAPI doesn't support adding tools via their API with server configurations. You need to add them manually.

### Option 1: Manual Addition (Recommended)

1. Go to [vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai) and log in
2. Navigate to **Assistants**
3. Click on **"MaintenanceBot - Unified Assistant"**
4. Scroll to **"Tools"** or **"Functions"** section
5. For each tool, add the configuration

**I'll create simplified configurations for you to copy/paste...**

---

## üìù Simplified Tool Configurations for VAPI Dashboard

### Tool 1: createWorkOrder

**Note:** VAPI doesn't support custom server URLs directly in the dashboard for function tools. You'll need to set up a **webhook/middleware server** that receives the function call from VAPI and forwards it to DoorLoop.

---

## üîÑ Webhook Server Required

**Important:** VAPI function tools can't directly call DoorLoop API. You need a middleware server that:

1. Receives function calls from VAPI
2. Transforms the data
3. Calls DoorLoop API
4. Returns response to VAPI

### Webhook Server Setup Options

**Option A: Build Your Own**
- Node.js/Express server
- Python/Flask server
- Receives POST requests from VAPI
- Calls DoorLoop API endpoints

**Option B: Use No-Code Tools**
- Make.com
- Zapier
- n8n (self-hosted)

**Option C: Use the serverUrl in VAPI**
Set `serverUrl` in your assistant to your webhook endpoint:
```
https://your-domain.com/vapi/webhook
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Webhook Server

Your webhook server needs to handle these requests:

**Endpoint:** `POST /vapi/webhook`

**Request from VAPI:**
```json
{
  "message": {
    "type": "function-call",
    "functionCall": {
      "name": "createWorkOrder",
      "parameters": {
        "unitNumber": "204",
        "tenantName": "Sarah Johnson",
        "tenantPhone": "555-789-1234",
        "issueDescription": "Kitchen sink leaking",
        "urgency": "urgent",
        "category": "plumbing"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Your Server Should:**
1. Extract function name and parameters
2. Map urgency to DoorLoop priority:
   - `urgent` ‚Üí `High`
   - `standard` ‚Üí `Medium`
   - `low` ‚Üí `Low`
3. Call DoorLoop API:
   ```
   POST https://app.doorloop.com/api/tasks
   Authorization: Bearer [your_token]
   ```
4. Return response to VAPI

### Step 2: Update Assistant Configuration

In VAPI dashboard:
1. Edit your assistant
2. Set **Server URL** to: `https://your-domain.com/vapi/webhook`
3. Add functions (tools) with just the function definitions (no server config)

**Option A:** Node.js/Express server (ready to deploy)
**Option B:** Python/Flask server (ready to deploy)
**Option C:** Instructions for Make.com/Zapier setup

Let me know and I'll create it!

---

## üîç Testing Your Integration

### Test 1: Create Work Order
1. Test your assistant in VAPI
2. Say: "My sink is leaking in unit 204"
3. Provide details when asked
4. Check DoorLoop - new task should appear

### Test 2: Emergency
1. Say: "My heat isn't working and it's 20 degrees outside"
2. Bot should create high-priority task
3. Check DoorLoop - emergency task with üö® should appear

### Test 3: Followup
1. Say: "I'm calling about the repair completed yesterday"
2. Confirm it's fixed
3. Check DoorLoop - task should be marked "Completed"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Vendor Assignment
- Currently set to **NOT auto-assign vendors**
- Property manager must manually assign vendor after task is created
- Future: Can add vendor assignment logic

### Emergency Protocol
- Bot creates high-priority task
- Property manager notified
- Manual vendor dispatch required
- Can automate this later with vendor on-call rotation

### Task Statuses
Using DoorLoop standard statuses:
- **Not Started** - New tasks
- **In Progress** - Vendor assigned/working
- **Completed** - Work finished
- **Cancelled** - Cancelled by property manager

### Priority Mapping
- **High** = Urgent/Emergency (2-hour response)
- **Medium** = Standard (24-hour response)
- **Low** = Low priority (3-5 days)

2. **Deploy webhook** to your hosting
3. **Update VAPI assistant** with webhook URL
4. **Add function definitions** to assistant
5. **Test integration** with sample scenarios
6. **Monitor DoorLoop** for task creation
